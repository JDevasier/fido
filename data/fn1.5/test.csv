For this reason we call the Perceiver role Perceiver_passive. Comparing the Perception_experience frame to the Perception_active frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.~$~Hear: The Hearer receives a Message or communication on a particular Topic. Words in this frame denote events of verbal communication, but express the Hearer rather than the Speaker as an External Argument.   'Teenage fans first heard about the tragedy on a popular radio show.'   'Teenage fans first heard the tragic news on a popular radio show'"

Motion_noise verbs take largely the same Source, Path and Goal expressions as other types of Motion verbs.  'The reception doors banged open.' 'Guillemots and razor bills whirred rapidly out to sea.' 'The limousine purred forwards into the traffic.' 'Loose guns rumbled all over the ship's deck .' 'The train clanged along for over a thousand miles.'~$~Cause_to_make_noise: An Agent manipulates a Sound_maker or a Cause causes the Sound_maker to emit a sound.  'The monks would ring the bell until sundown.'~$~Sounds: This frame is  concerned with the percepts that vibrations which travel through the air or another medium produce in hearing organs. Sounds are a subtype of sensation. In talking about sounds, speakers often provide information about how the sound was produced. A Noisy_event may be mentioned which gives rise to the sound. Alternatively, the sound may be attributed to a Sound_source, which is construed as a point source emitting the sound. A further possible specification of what gives rise to the sound is for speakers to talk about two physical entities coming into contact by motion, resulting in either friction or impact.~$~Make_noise: A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.  ''   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."

The Part itself connects locations within the building to each other, Connected_locations. If a particular point of view is adopted in the context of real or imagined motion, then one of the locations can be construed as Goal and the other as Source.

This frame includes natural geographic features, including land/ice forms and bodies of water.  ' We climbed up the rock cliff.'~$~Sensation: This frame contains nouns that refer to sensations in different modalities. The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)~$~Make_noise: A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.

This frame includes natural geographic features, including land/ice forms and bodies of water.  ' We climbed up the rock cliff.' ~$~Traversing: A Theme changes location with respect to a salient Path location.~$~Passing: An Agent physically transfers a Theme to a Recipient. The Agent is not under control of the Theme's motion after the initial input of energy.   Compare with Bringing and Sending. In the former, the Carrier is in constant control (even physical contact) with the Theme. In the latter, the Sender plans the motion of the Theme and places it in circumstances such that it travels along the specified path (or to the specified goal), but under the power of a separate individual.~$~Process_end: A Process comes to an end.~$~Giving: A Donor transfers a Theme from a Donorto a Recipient.  This frame includes only actions that are initiated by the Donor (the one that starts out owning the Theme).  Sentences (even metaphorical ones) must meet the following entailments: the  Donor first has possession of the Theme.  Following the transfer the Donor no longer has the Theme and the Recipient does. 'Barney gave the beer to Moe.' '$300 was endowed to the university.to build a new performing arts building.'~$~Path_shape: The words in this frame describe the ""fictive"" motion of a stationary Road.  Some of the targets cast the scene primarily in terms of the Path_shape:  'The long mountain road meandered through the woods.'  Some of the words in this frame imply a Source or Goal which is expressed by a direct object:  'The path entered the garden on the west side.'  Other members of the frame refer to a Direction: 'Then the path bears a little to the right.'  Yet others indicate a Path which requires mention of a landmark:  'The otherwise arrow-straight highway veers north and skirts the lake.'"

The Path may be described in various terms depending on whether it is bounded or not. If it is bounded, the Path may be identified by its Endpoints, which may be presented separately as Source and Goal.  'For Earth, these perturbations slowly change the eccentricity of the planet's orbit around the Sun.'  'From the eyewitness accounts, as well as satellite data, videos and photos, Brown and his team have worked out the meteor's path through space.'  'Its period around Saturn is just under one Earth day, meaning that it really barrels along, to cover its 700,000 mile orbit in such a short time.'~$~Roadways: This frame involves stable Roadways which connect two stable Endpoints, the Source and the Goal.  Being physical objects, these Roadways may have Names and Characteristics; they are also made of a Material.  They also cover ground, so they may have a Path or a Relative_location that the travel occurs in.  ' We crossed the brick road.' ' I prefer to travel on highway I-80.'

The Agent, or metonymically the Instrument or Means action, is described in terms of the actual or expected Deviation between the location, time, or quantity in the activity and the location, time, or quantity which is necessary for the intended event.  'The Longview Rangefinder is accurate to within one foot per hundred yards .' 'His estimate was off by an order of magnitude .'  'The fork truck operator must be fairly accurate in his aim.'  'The precision of the daily measurements is dependent on a number of factors.'~$~Locative_relation: A Figure is located relative to a Ground location.

We consider sequenced calendric units (e.g. Tuesday, 1987, January) as periods for the purposes of this frame.  Some lexical items allow certain types of frame elements while disallowing others (e.g. *During Tuesday...).  Several words of this frame (e.g. now.adv) have deictic incorporation of the Landmark_period.  'He tried to take care of that on his last visit .' 'I especially like brunch on Sunday.' 'Dinosaurs lived in prehistoric eras.'  'He did it then.'~$~Topic: A stretch of linguistic discourse or a Text that a Communicator produces has a Topic that it is about.

(This frame may be broadened to include non-agentive intermediate actions.)  'The primary means of gas detection is mass spectroscopy .' 'They learned of the attack by monitoring the allied communications channels .'~$~Being_in_operation: A Device or machine is in (or out of) service. Note that being broken or functional is a separate issue from being turned on or off. This latter notion is what the present frame is concerned with. <br /> The Time when and the Place where the Device is in use may be specified, as may be the Purpose a backgrounded human User had in turning the Device on or off.

This may be a Characterization describing purely perceptual properties, an Appraisal (i.e. positive or negative judgment) or an Inference about some non-perceptual property based on the Perceiver_passive's perception.~$~Scrutiny: This frame concerns a Cognizer (a person or other intelligent being) paying close attention to something, the Ground, in order to discover and note its salient characteristics.  The Cognizer may be interested in a particular characteristic or entity, the Phenomenon, that belongs to the Ground or is contained in the Ground (or to ensure that such a property of entity is not present).  Some words in this frame allow alternate expressions of the Groundand the Phenomenon: 'We searched the yard  for my contact lens.'~$~Seeking: A Cognizer_agent attempts to find some Sought_entity by examining some Ground.  The success or failure of this activity (the Outcome) may be indicated. NB:  This frame should be compared to the Scrutiny frame, in which the primary focus is on the Ground.~$~Facial_expression: The words in this frame refer to facial Expressions and the Possessors of those Expressions.~$~Perception_active: This frame contains perception words whose perceivers intentionally direct their attention to some entity or phenomenon in order to have a perceptual experience.  For this reason we call the perceiver role in this frame Perceiver_agentive.    'She gazed upon him fondly.'  Comparing the Perception_active frame to the Perception_experience frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_active contains the verb phrase look at, Perception_experience contains see.   For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical item in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell.  This first sentence exemplifies the Perception_active use of the verb smell:'Smell this to see if it's fresh.CNI' This second sentence exemplifies its Perception_experience sense: 'I smell something rotten.'"

'He decided to stay in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.'  'The largest city in the area, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda county.'~$~Grasp: A Cognizer possesses knowledge about the workings, significance, or meaning of an idea or object, which we call Phenomenon, and is able to make predictions about the behavior or  occurrence of the Phenomenon. The Phenomenon may be incorporated into the wider knowledge structure via categorization, which can be indicated by the mention of a Category. The Cognizer may possess knowledge only in part and this may be expressed in a Completeness expression. The Cognizer may also be realized as a cognitive-emotional Faculty that is conceived of as having understanding. Note that the knowledge may have been acquired either from instruction or from the Cognizer's own experimentation, observation, or mental operations.  Words in this frame are frequently used metonymically to denote the transition into the state described above.  'I figured this out last week and now I really understand it.'  'My father failed to comprehend that his explanations were based as much upon faith as mine'  'The draughtsman must fully comprehend what he is drawing'  'Nobody seems to have explained this to her, but finally she understands DNI'  'I realized I had not properly understood my own needs'  'The mind is often unable to comprehend the significance of what it perceives.'  'Our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels (spiking frequencies) in the appropriate sensory pathways. CNI'~$~Causation: A Cause causes an Effect.  Alternatively, an Actor, a participant of a (implicit) Cause, may stand in for the Cause.  Those frames that inherit the Causation frame have as their background the idea that some event is responsible for the occurrence of another event (or state).  In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.  'He made me angry.'  'If such a small earthquake causes problems, just imagine a big one!'  'The strange mutations of the rumor mill in the end led to it being said that he was actually a woman.'  'You 've made it impossible to continue!'  'The ending left me feeling kinda empty.'~$~Categorization: A Cognizer construes an Item as belonging to a certain Category.  In this process, the Cognizer may either passively perceive the Item and note that it fits the Criteria for a Category, or, alternatively, actively examine the Item for certain Criteria that define a Category (or set of Categorys).    Most members of the frame can also describe a resulting cognitive state of the Cognizer with respect to the Item and Category which no longer requires the current perception or consideration of the Item.  A few LUs (e.g. peg.v, pigeonhole.v) do not readily allow stative interpretation, and a few LUs (e.g. deem.v, regard.v) only allow stative interpretation.  'You 've already stereotyped me as a bimbo, have n't you?'~$~Perception_experience: This frame contains perception words whose Perceivers have perceptual experiences that they do not necessarily intend to. For this reason we call the Perceiver role Perceiver_passive. Comparing the Perception_experience frame to the Perception_active frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.~$~Touring: A Tourist experiences an Attraction, a location with a unique history or other societally recognized individual character, with the goal of seeing and learning about it. Typically, the Attraction has a source of information about the Attraction--a guide, pamphlets, or displays.~$~Reference_text: In a text, a Source_of_information is given that provides a reader of the text with further Information relevant to the text. In this frame the author and reader are completely deprofiled, with the Source_of_information made salient.  'In Densmore's days it was sometimes made of an old-fashioned man's celluloid collar (cf. Densmore 1943: 116).'  'The 'foaming regions' play the role of 'internal shocks' (cf. Piran's recent publication for a review) of GRB theory.'
