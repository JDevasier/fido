15020,united states helps uzbekistan secure dangerous nuclear materials : energy agency announces completion of secret uranium transfer back to russia,help.v,2,help.v: make it easier for (someone) to do something.,Assistance,Assistance: A Helper benefits a Benefited_party by enabling the culmination of a Goal that the Benefited_party has.  A Focal_entity that is involved in reaching the Goal may stand in for it.  'Will you help the Government find your brother?' 'Maybe Stephen should assist him with the last manuscript.' 'They helped me psychologically to overcome the physical loss I had suffered.' 'You have helped him tremendously by showing him  how to stand up for himself and by being his friend.'

15021,united states helps uzbekistan secure dangerous nuclear materials : energy agency announces completion of secret uranium transfer back to russia,secure.v,4,secure.v: succeed in obtaining.~$~secure.v: ~$~secure.v: protect against threats~$~secure.v: make secure; fix or fasten securely,Getting~$~Being_at_risk~$~Protecting~$~Attaching,"Getting: A Recipient starts off without the Theme in their possession, and then comes to possess it.  Although the Source from which the Theme came is logically necessary, the Recipient and its changing relationship to the Theme is profiled.  'I got two whistles from John.'~$~Being_at_risk: An Asset is in a state where it is exposed to or otherwise liable to be affected by a Harmful_event, which may be metonymically evoked by reference to a Dangerous_entity. Words expressing relative safety (i.e., lack of risk) are also in this frame.  'If you are a farmer, you are at risk for hearing loss caused by noise exposure in your work.'  'No child is secure from the temptation to do what ""my friends"" are doing.'  'Our nation is making a disastrous mistake thinking that we can have security from people: There is only security with people. '  'You don't have security against impersonation unless you have security against eavesdropping.'~$~Protecting: Some Protection prevents a Danger from harming an Asset.  'The rubber on her sneakers protected her from the mud.'  'The coral reefs shielded the coastline from the worst of the waves.'  'A growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising ?heritage? or ?heirloom? varieties.'  'The man responsible for this entire ordeal cowardly shielded himself from justice with the little boy's struggling body.'~$~Attaching: The Attaching frame covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically connected to something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be connected to each other.  In the first, the frame includes an Agent who attaches an Item to a Goal by manipulating a Connector, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Goal.  In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'  'Make sure you bind his wrists as tightly as possible.'",2

There is no Cognizer present on the scene, in distinction to the Expectation frame where a Cognizer takes (the equivalent of) Phenomenon_1 as evidence for (the equivalent of) Phenomenon_2. Many words in this frame also allow a slightly different understanding, whereby Phenomenon_1 provides clues as to the good or bad Outcome of an expected Phenomenon_2. Instead of Phenomenon_2 an Interested_party that will be involved in the event or state that is Phenomenon_2 may be mentioned. In both construals, the two phenomena are asymmetrical and consequently they have no joint syntactic realization.  '  Such potential augurs  well  for the 1990s ' 'Its appearance was an  ill omen. ' 'Cold-blooded words do not necessarily betoken a callous nature.' 'I wish I could say my success  bodes well for him.'~$~Statement: This frame contains verbs and nouns that communicate the act of a Speaker to address a Message to some Addressee using language.

The person responsible for the hiding of the Phenomenon is not part of this frame and cannot be syntactically realized. The potential Cognizer may be realized, but is in fact rarely expressed. A period of Time during which the Phenomenon is secret may be indicated.   'Few people would use ATMs if the content of their transaction was secret from their bank and there was no paper trail verifying the transaction. .'

The Situation may be a state, an activity, or some focal entity that must be inferred to be part of some larger Situation involving both it and the Asset. Although the idea of a harmful event is crucial to the understanding of this frame, it is not expressible as an argument of the LUs in this frame.  'Is climate change dangerous for mankind?' 'Customers can make complaints about unsafe products.' 'The primary risk is to our infrastructure.'   See the Run_risk frame for discussion on differentiation regarding the noun risk.",0
